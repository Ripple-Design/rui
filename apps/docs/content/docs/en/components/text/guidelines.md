## Usage guidelines

Use Text when you want to apply a named typography variant while keeping semantic HTML tags explicit or overridable.

### Prefer inherited color

Without `color`, Text inherits the surrounding foreground. This keeps text on a Surface aligned with its semantic on-surface, on-primary, or on-secondary treatment.

### Use emphasis for hierarchy

Use `high`, `medium`, and `low` to distinguish primary, supporting, and de-emphasized content. Explicit `color` selects the primary, secondary, or onsurface token family.

### Disabled content

`disabled` forces low emphasis regardless of the supplied `emphasis` and adds `aria-disabled="true"` to communicate the unavailable state.
